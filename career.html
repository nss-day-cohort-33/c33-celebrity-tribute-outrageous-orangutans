    <div class='intro'>
      <p class="wrestling">
        Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson had a promising football career that was cut
        short due to a number of injuries. It was not over for him, however. He
        joined the WWF in 1996, a year after graduating from the University of
        Miami. In a little over 10 years of professional wrestling, 'The Rock'
        was launched into Superstardom. Everybody knows his catchphrase, "Can
        you smell what the Roockk isss Cooookinnn?!"
      </p>
      <p class="beyondWrestling">
        The Rock did not fully settle with his mega famous wrestling career. In
        1999, Dwayne began his acting debut. His acting career had a relatively
        slow start in small television roles. The rock kept at it, and within a
        couple of years he was starring in major Hollywood movies. Over the past
        20 years, Dwayne Johnson has been in at least 44 movies! He was even the
        second highest paid actor in the world in 2018, following George
        Clooney.
