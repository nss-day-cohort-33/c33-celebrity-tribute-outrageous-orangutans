    <h1>Dwayne Johnson</h1>

    <!-- Intro to artist -->
    <div class="intro">
      <h2 class="career">Career</h2>
      <p class="wrestling">
        Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson had a promising football career that was cut
        short due to a number of injuries. It was not over for him, however. He
        joined the WWF in 1996, a year after graduating from the University of
        Miami. In a little over 10 years of professional wrestling, 'The Rock'
        was launched into Superstardom. Everybody knows his catchphrase, "Can
        you smell what the Roockk isss Cooookinnn?!" The Rock did not fully
        settle with his mega famous wrestling career. In 1999, Dwayne began his
        acting debut. His acting career had a relatively slow start in small
        television roles. The rock kept at it, and within a couple of years he
        was starring in major Hollywood movies. Over the past 20 years, Dwayne
        Johnson has been in at least 44 movies! He was even the second highest
        paid actor in the world in 2018, following George Clooney.

          "Wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne Johnson’s endorsement deal with Under

          “He represents very little risk, he has an incredibly high audience
          match with the Under Armour customer base and so he has very high
          resonance, recognition and trust scores — they believe him, they

          Johnson, known as “The Rock,” started his partnership with Under
          Armour in January 2016 and a Project Rock 1 sneaker released in May
          2018 sold out in less than 24 hours, according to a post on Johnson’s
          Instagram account. He also starred in Under Armour’s “Will Finds A
          Way” ad campaign, which launched in April. (CNBC)
