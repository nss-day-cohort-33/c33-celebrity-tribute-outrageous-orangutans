          undergraduate days at the University of Miami where she majored in
          international marketing and finance. She has been right alongside
          Johnson, supporting him through his multiple career transitions, from
          an aspiring professional football player, to star wrestler, and now
          actor/mogul. They share a daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson. Dany
          asked for a divorce for no confirmed reason. Their divorce is
